# Interaction System

The purpose of this project was to develop a system enabling players to engage with in-game objects. This system was integrated into the First-Person Interaction Demo I designed, featuring actions such as picking up objects, setting them down, opening doors, and operating levers. The code for this system was written in C# and is easily customizable to include various other types of interactions.
